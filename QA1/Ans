Question 1: By default are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously?
Answer: Django signals are executed synchronously by default. When a signal is sent, the receiver functions are executed immediately in the order they were connected.

Code Snippet:
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# A simple receiver function
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    print("User saved:", instance.username)

class SignalTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_user_save_signal(self):
        user = User(username='testuser')
        user.save()  # This will trigger the user_saved signal synchronously.
